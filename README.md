# Personal Statistics

Recently I downloaded an application called Reporter and this repository is the
culmination of code to take the data that is stored in the cloud and create
interesting visual representation of it.

## Current Support

- Geographic Representation of places I have Been

## Features Desired

- Inclusion of activites I do
- Automatic retrieval from cloud backup in server
- Inclusion to personal website
